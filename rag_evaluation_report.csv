We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\nitself.

What significant event involving the Wright's plane led to some of its first mentions in 1908?,"['Even after people caught on to the plane’s wonder, they\nunderestimated it for years.\nFirst it was seen mainly as a military weapon. Then a rich\nperson’s toy. Then, perhaps, used to transport a few people.\nThe Washington Post wrote in 1909: “There will never be\nsuch a thing as commercial aerial freighters. Freight will\ncontinue to drag its slow weight across the patient earth.”\nThe ﬁrst cargo plane took oﬀ ﬁve months later.\nNow compare that slow, years-long awakening to becoming\noptimistic about the airplane to how quickly people pay\nattention to drivers of pessimism, like a corporate\nbankruptcy.\nOr a major war.\nOr a plane crash. Some of the ﬁrst mentions of the Wright’s\nplane came in 1908 when an Army Lieutenant named\nThomas Selfridge was killed during a demonstration ﬂight.⁶²\nGrowth is driven by compounding, which always takes time.\nDestruction is driven by single points of failure, which can\nhappen in seconds, and loss of conﬁdence, which can\nhappen in an instant.', 'build a printing press. It was the brothers’ ﬁrst joint\ninvention. It would not be their last.\nIf you had to make a list of the most important inventions of\nthe 20th century, the airplane would be at least top ﬁve, if\nnot number one. The airplane changed everything. It started\nworld wars, it ended world wars. It connected the world,\nbridging gaps between cities and rural communities; oceans\nand countries.\nBut the story of the Wright Brothers’ quest to build the ﬁrst\nplane has a fascinating twist.\nAfter they conquered ﬂight, no one seemed to notice.\nNobody seemed to care.\nIn his 1952 book on American history, Frederick Lewis Allen\nwrote:\n\xa0\nSeveral years went by before the public grasped what the\nWrights were doing; people were so convinced that ﬂying\nwas impossible that most of those who saw them ﬂying\nabout Dayton [Ohio] in 1905 decided that what they had\nseen must be some trick without signiﬁcance—somewhat as\nmost people today would regard a demonstration of, say,', 'alone impacted the world orders upon orders of magnitude\nmore than others.\nThe thing that makes tail events easy to underappreciate is\nhow easy it is to underestimate how things compound. How,\nfor example, 9/11 prompted the Federal Reserve to cut\ninterest rates, which helped drive the housing bubble, which\nled to the ﬁnancial crisis, which led to a poor jobs market,\nwhich led tens of millions to seek a college education, which\nled to $1.6 trillion in student loans with a 10.8% default\nrate. It’s not intuitive to link 19 hijackers to the current\nweight of student loans, but that’s what happens in a world\ndriven by a few outlier tail events.\nThe majority of what’s happening at any given moment in\nthe global economy can be tied back to a handful of past\nevents that were nearly impossible to predict.\nThe most common plot of economic history is the role of\nsurprises.

It’s because the', '(and best) events of the future is not following history;\nthey’re accidentally assuming that the history of\nunprecedented events doesn’t apply to the future.\nNassim Taleb writes in his book Fooled By Randomness:\n\xa0\nIn Pharaonic Egypt … scribes tracked the high-water mark of\nthe Nile and used it as an estimate for a future worst-case\nscenario.

It had been built to withstand the\nworst past historical earthquake, with the builders not\nimagining much worse—and not thinking that the worst\npast event had to be a surprise, as it had no precedent.\n\xa0\nThis is not a failure of analysis. It’s a failure of imagination.\nRealizing the future might not look anything like the past is\na special kind of skill that is not generally looked highly\nupon by the ﬁnancial forecasting community.\nAt a 2017 dinner I attended in New York, Daniel Kahneman\nwas asked how investors should respond when our forecasts', 'So the era of “This isn’t working” may stick around.\nAnd the era of “We need something radically new, right now, whatever it is” may stickaround.\nWhich, in a way, is part of what starts events that led to things like World War II, where thisstory began.\nHistory is just one damned thing after another.']","Some of the first mentions of the Wright's plane in 1908 occurred when Army Lieutenant Thomas Selfridge was killed during a demonstration flight.
